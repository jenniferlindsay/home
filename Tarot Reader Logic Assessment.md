# Step 4: Tarot Reader Logic Assessment #
**1. What were the weights of the cats?**  
The weights are 1kg, 6kg, and 6kg.  
  
**2. How did you arrive at that answer? Show your process.**  
I determined which sets of three numbers have a product of 36. These numbers are:  
  
1kg, 1kg, 36kg  
1kg, 2kg, 18kg  
1kg, 3kg, 12kg  
1kg, 4kg, 9kg  
1kg, 6kg, 6kg  
2kg, 2kg, 9kg  
2kg, 3kg, 6kg  
3kg, 3kg, 4kg  
  
When the tarot reader said that the cats’ weights added together gives the same number as the price of a tarot reading, Bookis was still confused. Since Bookis knew the price of a tarot reading, but this hint still didn’t reveal the answer to him, it means that there were two or more answers that add up to the same number as the price of a tarot reading. I checked the sum of the sets, and the sets 1, 6, 6, and 2, 2, 9 both have a sum of 13 and a product of 36. The last hint that Bookis got was that there is a “littlest kitty.” That means that the two smaller numbers cannot be the same, which eliminates 2, 2, 9 and leaves us with 1, 6, 6. Therefore, the cats weighed 1kg, 6kg, and 6kg.

**3. What other possible answers are there?**  
This is the only answer where each of the hints are true.
